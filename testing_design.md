## Motivation
Correctness checking, verification... wanted to test to make sure shit didnt break

Another issue: how should we implement this? Architecture decisions

Mix of both: design priority should be verificability/ease of checking/testing

## Solution
Post about testing (lookup; intro to tdd and its flaws)

Let the tests shape the API
